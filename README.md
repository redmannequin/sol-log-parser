# sol-log-parser

A quick and dirty solana log parser that turns runtime logs into structured data.
Useful for debugging, tracing program execution, or just making sense of the chaos that is Solana logs.

## Why

Solana logs are structured, but not structured structured. This parses them just enough to make them usable by machines (and less annoying for humans).

## Status

Still messy. Still useful.
PRs are welcomed.
